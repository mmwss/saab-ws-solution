"""
Create a Python script that analyzes sentiment in customer reviews. The script should:

- Read customer reviews from a JSON file.
- Use a sentiment analysis API to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of each review.
- Aggregate the results to show the total number of reviews in each sentiment category.
- Save the annotated reviews with their sentiments back to a new JSON file.
