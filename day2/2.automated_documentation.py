class ProcHelper:

    A helper class for processing datasets and performing calculations
    based on specific thresholds and criteria.

    Attributes:
        threshold (float): The threshold value used for conditional processing.
        current (float): The accumulated value after processing, modified by certain conditions.
        track (list): A list that tracks calculated values during processing.

    Methods:
        part_one(dataset):
            Processes the data from the dataset, applies helper_func, and tracks values.
        
        helper_func(a, b):
            Helper function that calculates a value based on conditions involving 'a' and 'b'.
        
        extra_step():
            Applies an additional processing step if certain conditions are met.
        
        finalize():
            Returns the final calculated value based on the threshold and the tracked values.
